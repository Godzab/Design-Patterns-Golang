__BRIDGE PATTERN__

**MOTIVATION**
- Objects use other object's fields and methods through embedding
- This allows us to make compound objects **e.g** mathematical expressions from smaller expressions
- Another example is a shape group from several different shapes
- It is a design pattern used to treat both single and composite objects uniformly
