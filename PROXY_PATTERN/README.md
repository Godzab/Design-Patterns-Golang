__PROXY PATTERN__

**MOTIVATION**
- Same interfcae with different behavior
- Like logging in applications
- An interface to a particular resource e.g storage
- A proxy has the same interface as the underlaying object
- To create a proxy you simply replicate the existing interface of an object.
- You then add relevant functionality to the redefined methods
