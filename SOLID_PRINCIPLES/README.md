__SUMMARY OF SOLID PRINCIPLES__

**Single Responsibility**

- A type should only have 1 reason to change
- Separation of concerns - Different packages should handle different issues

**Open Closed Principle**
- Types should be open for extension but closed for modification

**Liskov Substitution**
- Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

**Interface segregation principle**
- Don't put too much into a single interface. Split it into smaller components
- You might not need some combined functionality

**Dependency Inversion**
- High level modules should not depend upon low level ones. Use abstractions.
