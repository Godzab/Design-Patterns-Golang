__FACTORY PATTERN__

**MOTIVATION**

- When object creation logic becomes too convoluted.
- When a struct has too many fields and they need to be initialized correctly
- This is for wholesale object creation

`A seperate function can be used #constructor#`

This is a component responsible for the wholesale (not piece-wise) creation of objects.

**SUMMARY**
- This is a helper function for making struct instances
- Can be a struct or a dedicated function
