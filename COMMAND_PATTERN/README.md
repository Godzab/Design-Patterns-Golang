__COMMAND PATTERN__

**MOTIVATION**
- Ordinary statements are perishable
- When we want an object to represent an operation
- This is an object which represents an instruction to perfom a particular action.
- Contains all information for the action to be taken
- This is the basis on which Queues will be stored and executed when required - (As in Laravel)
